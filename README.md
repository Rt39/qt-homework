Using Qt library to build a small game.

**Warning: It contains some Chinese Charactors**

This is the first time I am using Qt. For the lack of experience, this game exists many bugs. A few bugs are listed below.

1. The program will crash when you start a new game while you are playing a game.
2. The assassin monster will move and disappear closer and closer to the right.
3. It is in the mainwindow.cpp. When uncommented the codes from line 144-164, segmentation faults occurs.
