# qt-homework
Using Qt library to build a small game.

This is the first time I am using Qt. For the lack of experience, this game exits many bugs. Now has found some.

1. The program will crash when you start a new game while you are playing a game.
2. The assasin monster will move and disappear closer and closer to the right.
